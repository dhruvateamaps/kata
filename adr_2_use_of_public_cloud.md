# 2. Use of public cloud infrastructure 


## Status
accepted

## Context
The Farmacy Foods application needs underlying IT infrastructure  
The application can be hosted on either on-prem or public cloud infrastructure


## Decision

### Design decision
We will use public cloud to host the application

### Design Justification
As a startup, Farmacy Foods is expecting an increase in users as well as geagraphical business expansion
Public cloud enables handling of such increases in capacity requirements

Further, Public cloud reduces the upfront capital expenditure that a startup would not want to commit to

## Consequences
Potential for vendor lock in


## Compliance

Farmacy Foods will be gathering some health related data  
Storing such data on the cloud will need compliance with major laws pertaining to health data
