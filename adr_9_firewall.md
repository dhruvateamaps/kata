# 9. Use of Web Application Firewall service from the cloud provider


## Status
accepted


## Context
Laws about personal data are getting stringent by the day. Users are also wary of organisations that don't take personal data privacy seriously. Non conformance to these legal and social requirements can lead to failure of the business idea.
Security incidents are also on the rise - with data breaches leading to loss of reputation and lawsuits.

We could utilse software firewalls, hardware firewalls from other vendors. We could also use the Web Application Firewall provided by the cloud vendor.


## Decision


### Design decision
We will use Web Application Firewall provided by the cloud vendor

### Design Justification
In addition to protection from malicious attacks, Web Application Firewall provided by the chosen cloud provider would have better support and integration


## Consequences
Additional configurations will be required and charges will be incurred
